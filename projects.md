Hello! I'm Hamid, a data scientist and machine learning enthusiast with a diverse background in physics and a passion for leveraging AI to solve real-world problems.

### Education

I hold a Ph.D. in Physics, where my analytical and problem-solving skills were honed. My academic journey eventually led me to explore the exciting world of data science and machine learning.

### Professional Experience:
I'm currently immersed in two exciting projects:

Relooped: I am working on development of a cutting-edge platform that utilizes AI to revolutionize fashion recommendations. By analyzing conceptual images, our system provides personalized fashion suggestions, making shopping an enjoyable and efficient experience.

MasterPie: I'm spearheading the creation of 'MasterPie,' an innovative app that harnesses the power of AI to deliver customized meal recommendations. This app tailors its suggestions to individual dietary preferences and restrictions, ensuring that users can enjoy delicious and healthy meals.

In addition to these projects, I've also completed a capstone project focusing on predictive analytics. Using a combination of logistic regression, random forest, XGBoost, and neural network algorithms, I successfully built a predictive model that accurately identified potential defaulters while minimizing false positives.

### More Information

I'm deeply passionate about harnessing data and AI to solve complex problems, and I'm excited about the limitless possibilities that lie ahead in the field of machine learning. My goal is to continue pushing the boundaries of what's possible in this dynamic field, making a positive impact on industries and individuals alike.

I'm always eager to collaborate, learn, and explore new opportunities. Whether you'd like to discuss a project, share insights, or simply connect, please feel free to reach out to me. Let's embark on this exciting journey together.
